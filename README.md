# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are incredibly powerful tools for both writing and sharing code.  They combine the functionality of an integrated development environment with the aesthetic feel and functionality of a markdown enabled notepad!  This tool makes an excellent environment for working with code but is also an excellent tool for presenting your findings in a procedural (and repeatable!) manner.

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate each of the functions included in Jupyter and to give you a chance to give them a try.


## Setup
This tutorial will focus on using Jupyter online via the Syzygy platform.  Unfortunately at present Jupyter Notebooks online require a brock login (with e-mail) to access.  This does not mean that you can't access it locally on your own machine or using a guest login on a campus computer.  For more information on getting and using Jupyter Notebooks without a brock login feel free to stop by the Digital Scholarship Lab in the Rankin Family Pavilion, or e-mail us at DSL@Brocku.ca.

1. Navigate to https://brocku.syzygy.ca
2. Click the red login house at the bottom of the screen and login using your brock login on the next page


## Navigating Jupyter - File Directory
Welcome to Jupyter Notebooks!  When you first login you will be taken to your file directory.  This is the storage space for any and all files that you will interact with using your code.  To add new files to your directory click the "Upload" button on the right.  Once you have your files to work with, make a new notebook using the "New" drop down menu and picking the programming language that you want to work in.

Once you have created your new Notebook an .ipynb file will be created in your file directory and your new Notebook will automatically open for you in a new tab (or window depending on your settings).

## Navigating Jupyter - The Notebook

Your new notebook is now ready to go!  Let's take a look at the different aspects of a Notebook!

### Cells

Notebooks are made up of two main types of cells: Code and Markdown.  

Code cells are where you type your code and run it.  By default new cells that you make using the "+" button will be code cells.  Once you have typed some code into a code cell you can run that code either by clicking the "Run" button at the top of the screen while that cell is selected or by pressing CTRL+ENTER on the keyboard
