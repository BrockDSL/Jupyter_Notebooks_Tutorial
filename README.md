# Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are incredibly powerful tools for both writing and sharing code.  They combine the functionality of an integrated development environment with the aesthetic feel and functionality of a markdown enabled notepad!  This tool makes an excellent environment for working with code but is also an excellent tool for presenting your findings in a procedural (and repeatable!) manner.

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate each of the functions included in Jupyter and to give you a chance to give them a try.
